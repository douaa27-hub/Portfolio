\section{Why I want to learn IT}
I want to learn IT because it opens many opportunities for my future. In addition, learning IT helps me to understand how networks and programs work, so instead of feeling lost in the digital world, IT helps us to understand it clearly.
Another reason is the flexibility that IT offers. With the right skills, I can work from anywhere, create my own projects, or even start my own online business. IT gives me the freedom to be creative and independent.

\section{Why I want to be in IT}
 I had heard about CELEC club before I entered USTHB and immediately knew I wanted to join. Although my experience is still limited, joining the club was a good decision. I got to meet some inspiring people and learn from a positive environment, which encouraged me to participate more and improve myself step by step.So yes, I decided to join the IT department, which is a very helpful space for improving my skills.
